We will need a 3D printer to print off part of our frame. This will require us to use either the 3D printer in the Central Library, or the 3D printer in Nedderman Hall Room 241. If later on we decide to use wood for some of our frame then we will need to borrow the band saw in Nedderman Hall Room 241. We will access to lab space when we assemble the laser harp. We will use lab space.

To test the laser harp we can conduct tests in the space where we will assemble the laser harp. Since the laser harp is stationary it will not require additional space to operate as it does not move. Addionally this space will need a power outlet as the laser harp will need to be powered electrically. We will require a space to hold the frame and harp. Other than the space needed to hold the laser harp, we will not need to use other space.

We do not intend to lease any equipment, nor do we expect to purchase any additional equipment or machines that were not specified in for this project. All machines and equipment is available to be borrowed in either the makerspace in Nedderman 241 or the UTA Central Library FabLab.
