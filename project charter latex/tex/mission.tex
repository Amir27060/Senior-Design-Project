Our mission is to design and create a laser synthesizer that works with MIDI controls manipulating the laser signals. The ‘laser synth’ is going to be portable and based on Arduino. The laser diodes emit laser signals which is detected by the system and an interference to it will be detected giving a signal for the audio output. We will also create a mobile app from which we can manipulate the audio output to different instrument sounds i.e. guitar, piano, etc. Additional features may be added as the project evolves.
